<!-- Install requirements:
 - docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

To initialize this project, run `docker compose up` from the root of this project. This will build and seed the database. By default the database runs on port `5432` and is also exposed on `5432`, if you want to change this you can update `docker-compose.yml`. -->

# Senior Backend Engineer Tech Challenge

## 1. Description

Please download below the starter package to save you time with the basic setup of this challenge.

-   You'll need Docker to spin up the test database.
-   You may use any package you like.
-   You may use JavaScript or TypeScript.

Inside this package, you will find a git project containing a Docker file that will bring up a Postgres database containing 2 tables: `vehicles` and `stateLogs`. These tables are already populated with some sample data.

The `vehicles` table has the data of cars that Motorway has sold in the past, or is in the process of selling. The vehicle's current state is defined in the `state` field. The state defines the lifecycle of a vehicle, from quoted to selling and sold.

The `stateLogs` table has the history of each vehicle's state transitions, from the moment it was created with the quoted state, to the most recent state transition.

Your task is to build an API with Node.js that, based on a vehicle id and a timestamp, returns a vehicle's information and the vehicle's state on the given timestamp.

For example, for the following `stateLogs`:

```json
[
    {
        "vehicleId": 3,
        "state": "quoted",
        "timestamp": "2022-09-11 09:11:45+00"
    },
    {
        "vehicleId": 3,
        "state": "selling",
        "timestamp": "2022-09-11 23:21:38+00"
    },
    {
        "vehicleId": 3,
        "state": "sold",
        "timestamp": "2022-09-12 12:41:41+00"
    }
]
```

if the API receives the timestamp `2022-09-12 10:00:00+00`, the response is the vehicle data, and the state of `selling` because it's the state that the vehicle was on that point in time.

Imagine this API endpoint is in a production environment and can be hit multiple times a second. Itâ€™s acceptable that clients can get a response stale by 1 minute.

Please prepare your project as you would for a production environment, considering reliability (this app would run in multiple instances), and testing.

## 2. Initial thoughts

#### 2.1 Technical requirements

#### 2.2 Motorway current technology stack [[link]](https://stackshare.io/motorway/core-platform)

#### 2.3 Motorway company values [[link]](https://www.notion.so/Motorway-Product-Engineering-culture-guide-42f8aee810d74ad3a4496fca520ae147)

#### 2.4 Time constraint

The fact that I had a maximum of 7 days to complete the challenge made me approach the test in a more pragmatic way:

-   Focus on the big picture first
-   Have an idea of what I would like to achieve every day
    -   Monday: call with Motorway internal recruiter
    -   Tuesday:

## 3. System design overview

#### 3.1 Coding language

I have used `TypeScript` because of:

-   reliability
-   productivity
-   type safety at compile time

#### 3.2 API

I have built a REST Api with one endpoint that fulfils the test requirement.

_"Based on a vehicle id and a timestamp, returns a vehicle's information and the vehicle's state on the given timestamp."_

-   Since the resource we want to return is a `Vehicle`, the url starts with the resource plural name and id parameter: `/vehicles/:vehicleId`
-   Since we want to return the state the vehicle was at a given timestamp, the url becomes: `vehicles/:vehicleId/timestamp/:timestamp`
-   Since it is a query the HTTP method is **GET**
-   This follows RESTful principles like:

    -   **client-server architecture**: the client and the server both have a different set of concerns
    -   **stateless**: the communication between the client and the server always contains all the information needed to perform the request
    -   **cacheble**: the client, the server and any intermediary components can all cache resources in order to improve performance
    -   **uniform interface**: all components follow the same rules to speak to one another
    -   **layered system**: individual components cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting

-   Example response for `http://localhost:3000/vehicles/2/timestamp/2022-09-19%2010:00:00+00`

```json
{
    "fromCache": false,
    "data": {
        "vehicle": {
            "id": 2,
            "make": "AUDI",
            "model": "A4",
            "state": "selling"
        }
    }
}
```
